Enchanted glass people, stealing their victims from frozen time. And a World War One captain destined to die on the battlefield, but taken from the trenches to play his part in the Doctor's story.\n\nAn uplifting new tale about the power of hope in humanity's darkest hours, Twice Upon A Time marks the end of an era. But as the Doctor must face his past to decide his future, his journey is only just beginning.\n\n'Twice Upon A Time' premieres Christmas night at 9/8c on BBC America.\n\nSubscribe now: http://bit.ly/1aP6Fo9\n\nThe Doctor (Peter Capaldi) is an alien Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey who travels through all of time and space in his TARDIS with his companion.
